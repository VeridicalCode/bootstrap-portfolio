				<p>Mine starts when I was eight years old, and my father - in what was arguably a rather questionable moment of
					parenting, but for which I am nevertheless eternally indebted to him - procured for my brother and I a curious
					new computer game called "DOOM." The game itself was reasonably entertaining, but the true magic on that
					little 128 kB floppy disc was a level editor - the very same tool the game devs had used to create the game
					itself. My brother and I beat DOOM in about three months. We kept making new levels for nearly three years.
				</p>
				<p>And in a way, I never really stopped. The games have changed and so have the tools, but that passion for both
					the structure itself and the edifices we build with it has carried me from my childhood through today.
					Modding, writing, full stack coding and debugging, front-end design and app development - it all comes from
					that moment of eight-year-old awe that I could take this piece of technology and
					make it say something new.</p>
				<p>So that's my story. I'd love to help you tell yours.</p>
